# Cboard Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan from a high level and will be updated as development progresses towards version 1.0. It should be noted that this roadmap applies to the project as a whole (frontend/backend).

## Quarter 1 - Profiles - Winter 2018
The first quarter focuses on providing support for user login, a basic REST API and DB layer implementation, this is done so we can sync user's boards and settings to the cloud and across platforms.

## Quarter 2 - Enviornment - Spring 2018
The second quarter deals mainly with environments. Setting up an environment for QA and Production. Choosing a suitable cloud service (Azure?), migration, setting up load balancers.

## Quarter 3 - Hardware support - Summer 2018
The third quarter continues some efforts from Q2, mainly setting up a CI.

We also have a few interesting features:
- Scanning/Switch (hardware) support.
- Predictive symbols/pictograms.
- Custom dashboards

## Quarter 4 - Prepare for launch - Fall 2018
The last quarter will focus on public beta release.
Setting up infrastructure to support traffic scaling based on estimation. Setting up metrics and Google Analytics.
Execute a communication plan (social media/blogs/etc.)
