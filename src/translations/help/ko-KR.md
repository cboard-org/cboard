### <a name='CanIregistermyselfusingmysocialmediaaccounts'></a>소셜 미디어 계정을 사용하여 본인을 등록 할 수 있습니까?

Yes! On the login page, you will be given the option to sign up with your Google or Facebook account if you wish to do so. You can also register with an e-mail address.

### <a name='HowdoIlogintoCboardonceIamaregistereduser'></a>등록 된 사용자 인 경우 Cboard에 어떻게 로그인합니까?

To log in to Cboard, you follow the first step used to sign up, but instead of selecting SIGN UP on the Welcome screen, select LOGIN. You will then be asked to provide the e-mail you initially signed up with, and the password you set up.

### <a name='WhatdevicesandOSaresupported'></a>어떤 장치와 OS가 지원됩니까?

Cboard is available online using a wide variety of devices, including desktops, tablets and mobile phones using Mac, Windows and Android operating systems. It is best viewed in browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari and an Android app is available from Google Play.

![브라우저 지원](/images/help/browsers.png "Browser support")

Because Cboard is a web based app it will respond to the settings provided by the individual browsers. This may mean you have different results to the settings provided by Cboard. For example you may find different speech options being offered.

컴퓨터, 태블릿 또는 휴대 전화 화면 크기에 따라 브라우저 확대 또는 확대 / 축소를 사용할 수도 있습니다.

이 유형의 웹 앱을 사용할 때는 브라우저 기반 옵션이 도움이되지 않으므로 시각 장애가있는 사용자를 위해 고 대비 모드 사용에 대해 Cboard에 문의하십시오.

### <a name='WhichlanguagesaresupportedbyCboard'></a>Cboard는 어떤 언어를 지원합니까?

Cboard comes with support for 33 languages. To select a different language go to SETTINGS – select LANGUAGE and those available will appear. Make a choice and a ‘tick’ will appear beside the language.

<div><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHq9b3dJ0zM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

### <a name='CanCboardreadmymessageoutaloud'></a>Cboard가 내 메시지를 소리내어 읽을 수 있습니까?

Yes, Cboard uses the synthetic speech output available on your device to read out individual labels found below each symbol as they are added to the message output box. You can select a complete message and it will also be read aloud. If a personalised recording of a sound, word or phrase has been added to a symbol (instructions under Talking – Voice Recordings) you will hear that recording instead of the synthesised voice. This can be very helpful where a translation is not available in a language, a child’s voice is needed or an accent is unacceptable. Please ensure web access has been given to your microphone.

### <a name='Speechcapabilities'></a>음성 기능

In order to adjust speech capabilities, go into SETTINGS, and under the LANGUAGE category is the SPEECH category. When you select SPEECH, you will be able to edit the pitch and pace of speech on Cboard.

### <a name='CanIchangeanynavigationsettings'></a>내비게이션 설정을 변경할 수 있습니까?

Use the NAVIGATION section to edit and facilitate the way you use to move around Cboard and delete symbols in the message box. Navigation at the end of the SYSTEM Category in SETTINGS allows you to have a larger ‘back’ button that is easier to select. It is also possible to allow a delete (‘x’) button to appear above each symbol as they are presented within the message box. This can make it easier to delete symbols within a sentence. But be aware of user needs as it can also confuse some individuals.

### <a name='Navigationthroughtheinterface'></a>인터페이스를 통한 탐색

In order to edit and facilitate navigating through Cboard, select NAVIGATION, the last menu item within SYSTEM (all in Settings) allows you to add certain details to make using the board easier. The first option within Navigation allows a larger ‘back’ button that is easier to select because of the size. The second adds an ‘x’ button to make it easier to delete symbols, and the third makes it easier to unlock by requiring only one click to unlock settings.

### <a name='HowdoIcreateanemptyboard'></a>How do I create an empty board?

In Cboard an empty board is equivalent to a folder.

If you want to create a new or empty board you have to create a new folder, and that will create a new board in the Cboard storage area (which you can see when you go to BOARDS on the middle bar in edit mode).

The new empty board will be immediately available for editing and can be set as the root board (using the build button), which means that it will be the first board you see the next time you open Cboard.

To create a new folder, begin by unlocking the screen selecting the lock button on the right hand side. Once you unlock the screen, select the plus (+) symbol on the right hand side, in order to ADD TILE. You will then be given the option to add a Tile / BUTTON which is the first and automatic option or select the FOLDER This action makes a NEW BOARD to which you can add more tiles and folders.

Once you have named the folder you can upload an image in a similar manner to making a tile with a color setting and label. This new folder will automatically link to a board above it (if included a row of tiles). It will appear in your list of boards as an empty board until it is populated with symbols and labels.
