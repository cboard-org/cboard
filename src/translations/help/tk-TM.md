### <a name='HowdoIlogintoCboardonceIamaregistereduser'></a>How do I log in to Cboard once I am a registered user?

To log in to Cboard, you follow the first step used to sign up, but instead of selecting SIGN UP on the Welcome screen, select LOGIN. You will then be asked to provide the e-mail you initially signed up with, and the password you set up.

Once you login to Cboard, you can access different options to configure and develop the Communication Board provided when Cboard is in unlocked mode. See the list of all the key options below:

![Cboard settings](/images/help/settings.png "Cboard settings")

### <a name='HowdoIlogout'></a>How do I logout?

You can log out by selecting the settings icon, and the option will appear in red. You can also select the lock symbol on the right corner, click three times and once you unlocked the screen and the red bar appears, select the icon to the left of the lock (your picture if you have one loaded) and the option to log out will appear in red.

![Cboard logout](/images/help/logout.png "Cboard logout")

### <a name='Whatisthedifferencebetweenaregisteredandanon-registereduser'></a>What is the difference between a registered and a non-registered user?

A registered user is able to personalize their boards, and the changes made will be saved to their account so that when they log back in, they can use their customized boards. A non-registered user won't be able to save changes safely. We recommend registering just in case, so your changes are guaranteed to be saved.

### <a name='HowdoIupdatemyuserinformation'></a>How do I update my user information?

To update your user information, follow the same steps you would use if you were trying to log out. Select the lock symbol on the top right corner of the board – three clicks or taps, and once you unlock the screen, select the icon to the left of the lock (user name initials, photo), and you can then edit your user information.

### <a name='HowdoIresetmypassword'></a>How do I reset my password?

In order to reset your password, please e-mail support@cboard.io and we will get back to you.

## <a name='Features'></a>Features

### <a name='WhatdevicesandOSaresupported'></a>What devices and OS are supported?

Cboard is available online using a wide variety of devices, including desktops, tablets and mobile phones using Mac, Windows and Android operating systems. It is best viewed in browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari and an Android app is available from Google Play.

![Browser support](/images/help/browsers.png "Browser support")

Because Cboard is a web based app it will respond to the settings provided by the individual browsers. This may mean you have different results to the settings provided by Cboard. For example you may find different speech options being offered.

Don’t forget you can also use browser magnification or zoom to a certain degree depending on the computer, tablet or phone screen size.

Please ask Cboard about using high contrast mode for those with visual impairment as browser based options are not helpful when using this type of web app.

### <a name='WhichlanguagesaresupportedbyCboard'></a>Which languages are supported by Cboard?

Cboard comes with support for 33 languages. To select a different language go to SETTINGS – select LANGUAGE and those available will appear. Make a choice and a ‘tick’ will appear beside the language.

<div><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHq9b3dJ0zM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe></div>

### <a name='CanCboardreadmymessageoutaloud'></a>Can Cboard read my message out aloud?

Yes, Cboard uses the synthetic speech output available on your device to read out individual labels found below each symbol as they are added to the message output box. You can select a complete message and it will also be read aloud. If a personalised recording of a sound, word or phrase has been added to a symbol (instructions under Talking – Voice Recordings) you will hear that recording instead of the synthesised voice. This can be very helpful where a translation is not available in a language, a child’s voice is needed or an accent is unacceptable. Please ensure web access has been given to your microphone.

### <a name='Speechcapabilities'></a>Speech capabilities

In order to adjust speech capabilities, go into SETTINGS, and under the LANGUAGE category is the SPEECH category. When you select SPEECH, you will be able to edit the pitch and pace of speech on Cboard.

### <a name='CanIchangeanynavigationsettings'></a>Can I change any navigation settings?

Use the NAVIGATION section to edit and facilitate the way you use to move around Cboard and delete symbols in the message box. Navigation at the end of the SYSTEM Category in SETTINGS allows you to have a larger ‘back’ button that is easier to select. It is also possible to allow a delete (‘x’) button to appear above each symbol as they are presented within the message box. This can make it easier to delete symbols within a sentence. But be aware of user needs as it can also confuse some individuals.

### <a name='Navigationthroughtheinterface'></a>Navigation through the interface

In order to edit and facilitate navigating through Cboard, select NAVIGATION, the last menu item within SYSTEM (all in Settings) allows you to add certain details to make using the board easier. The first option within Navigation allows a larger ‘back’ button that is easier to select because of the size. The second adds an ‘x’ button to make it easier to delete symbols, and the third makes it easier to unlock by requiring only one click to unlock settings.

## <a name='BoardEditing'></a>Board Editing

### <a name='HowdoIcreateanemptyboard'></a>How do I create an empty board?

In Cboard an empty board is equivalent to a folder.

If you want to create a new or empty board you have to create a new folder, and that will create a new board in the Cboard storage area (which you can see when you go to BOARDS on the middle bar in edit mode).

The new empty board will be immediately available for editing and can be set as the root board (using the build button), which means that it will be the first board you see the next time you open Cboard.

To create a new folder, begin by unlocking the screen selecting the lock button on the right hand side. Once you unlock the screen, select the plus (+) symbol on the right hand side, in order to ADD TILE. You will then be given the option to add a Tile / BUTTON which is the first and automatic option or select the FOLDER This action makes a NEW BOARD to which you can add more tiles and folders.

Once you have named the folder you can upload an image in a similar manner to making a tile with a color setting and label. This new folder will automatically link to a board above it (if included a row of tiles). It will appear in your list of boards as an empty board until it is populated with symbols and labels.

Once the block is selected, the grey bar should turn blue, and on the right hand side you will see a small trash can and a pencil.

### <a name='FixedRows'></a>How do I set a specific number of rows and columns in my board?
