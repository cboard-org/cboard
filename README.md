# Cboard - AAC Communication Board for the Browser

[Cboard](https://shayc.github.io/cboard) is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) web app, allowing those with speech and language impairments (autism, cerebral palsy) to communicate by symbols and text-to-speech.

The app uses the browser's native Speech Synthesis API to generate speech when a symbol is clicked, there are 3400 symbols to choose from when creating a new board and it uses Service Worker API for a semi-offline experience.

Still in alpha stage.
