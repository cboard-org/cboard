# Cboard - AAC Communication Board for the Browser

[Cboard](https://shayc.github.io/cboard) is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) web app, allowing those with speech and language impairments (autism, cerebral palsy) to communicate by symbols and text-to-speech.

The app uses the browser's native Speech Synthesis API to generate speech, it contains 3400 symbols the user can use to create custom boards, and has semi-offline capabilities by using Service Worker API.

It is still in alpha version.

Note: languages are auto-translated (except English and Hebrew), as far as I know they are around 80% correct, we still need native speakers to proof-read, contact us for more info.
