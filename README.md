# Cboard - AAC Communication Board for the Browser

[Cboard](https://shayc.github.io/cboard) is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) web app, allowing those with speech and language impairments (autism, cerebral palsy) to communicate by symbols and text-to-speech.

The app uses the browser's native Speech Synthesis API to generate speech when a symbol is clicked, there are 3400 symbols to choose from when creating a new board and it uses Service Worker API for a semi-offline experience.

Still in alpha stage.

## Translations
Languages are auto-translated (except English and Hebrew), as far as I'm aware they are 80% correct, we need to proof-read Spanish, Russian, Hindi, French and more, we're using Crowdin as our translation platform, if you want to translate or proof-read, click this link: https://crowdin.com/project/cboard - you do not need to be a programmer to do this!
