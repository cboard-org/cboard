# Cboard - AAC Communication Board with Text-to-speech for modern browsers.

[Cboard](https://shayc.github.io/cboard) is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) web application, allowing those with speech and language impairments (autism, cerebral palsy) to communicate by symbols and text-to-speech.

The app uses the browser's native speechSynthesis API (where supported) to generate speech, it contains 3400 symbols, and has semi-offline capabilities by using Service Worker API.

It is still in alpha version, and we need all the help we can get, come join us!

Note: languages are auto-translated (except English and Hebrew), as far as I know they are 80% correct, we still need native speakers to proof read and fix, contact us for more info.
