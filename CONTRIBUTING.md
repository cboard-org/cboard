# Contributing to Cboard

Interested in contributing to Cboard? Thanks! There are plenty of ways you can help.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## What you need to know

In order to contribute you will need to have a basic understanding of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) and probably [Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux), you will also need to be familiar with [Material-UI](https://material-ui-next.com/).

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for Cboard. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

## Setting Up a Local Copy

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/cboard-org/cboard.git`

2. Run `npm install` in the root `cboard` folder.

Once it is done, you can modify any file locally and run `npm start`, `npm test` or `npm run build`.

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/cboard).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
