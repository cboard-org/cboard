## As a developer

### What you need to know

In order to contribute as a developer, you will need to have a basic understanding of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) and probably [Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux), you will also need to be familiar with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).

### Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for Cboard. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

### Setting Up a Local Copy

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/cboard-org/cboard.git`

2. Run `yarn install` in the root `cboard` folder.

Once it is done, you can modify any file locally and run `yarn start`, `yarn test` or `yarn run build`.

## As a translator

To help with translations and proofreading please use our translation management platform: https://crowdin.com/project/cboard

We currently support 40 languages, most of which were machine translated and require proofreading.
Help us make Cboard available in your country!

## As a manual tester

We track all of the project issues using Github:
https://github.com/cboard-org/cboard/issues
 
Our issue tracker is quite active, typically we got two-three bugs/week, then active tester participation is highly appreciated in order to clarify, reproduce, and track the bugs.
**We need help on writing a test plan!**
We have never written a test plan for cboard and it feels really bad. We will appreciate people that is able to design and create a comprehensive test plan covering all of the features and functions of the applications that are available in the Cboard system. 

## As an automation tester 
If you are proficient with automation testing, we will be happy if you can help us!. 
We have developed a little automation framework based on [Webdriver.io](https://webdriver.io/), that runs using the cloud service provided by [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/). Here you can find the repository to start collaborating: 
https://github.com/cboard-org/cboard-webdriverio

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/cboard).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
